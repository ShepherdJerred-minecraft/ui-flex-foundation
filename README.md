# UI.Flex-Foundation
UI.Flex-Foundaton emulates the look of the UI.Flex XenForo forum theme. It allows for creation of external pages that still match the style of the communities forum, which gives a native feel to any applications that may be needed to be hosted.

This template was made for the Red Warfare server, and thus will need to be customized for your own server. It's also blank, so you'll need to know HTML and CSS to do much with it.
